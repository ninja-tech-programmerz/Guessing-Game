Most of the programmers, think of their very first project after doing a Programming Language. Here, you will get your very first project and the basic one, in this Github Repo.

Task: Below are the steps:

1) Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
2) Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
3) Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer. If the guess is greater than the generated number then it will ask the user to lower the guess and vice versa
